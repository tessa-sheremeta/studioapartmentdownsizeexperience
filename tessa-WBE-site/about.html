        <h3>Realizing I Had a Problem</h3>

        <p>Written January 15, 2020</p>

        <p>It was back in the fall of 2018. My sister and I had been in our 900 square foot apartment for a few years and felt like we did not have enough space --- to work, socialize, or live! Our place was a very generous space, but it was definitely not being utilized properly. Time of me being unhappy had passed. I was deeply unsatisfied with working in retail, and had developed a bad habit of buying things like food, cosmetics, clothing, and home decor to make me happier.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, I knew I wanted to feel happier and more hopeful for my future by escaping the endless loop of one retail job after the next, so applied for school and got accepted into the IT program at a nearby polytechnic. During my time traveling to and from school, I'd have 40 minutes to and from where I got the chance to read the ever-popular book, 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up'. And boy, was it ever. That book along with randomly watching 'Minimalism' on Netflix were THE kick in the butt I needed to drastically shift my life.</p>

        <p>After watching 'Minimalism', I was ready to get started. I folled Marie Kondo's method of tidying; collecting items by category and gathering them in one pile, then holding each item at a time and deciding if it brought joy, had a needful purpose in my life, or was something that did neither and I could get rid of (responsibly).</p>
