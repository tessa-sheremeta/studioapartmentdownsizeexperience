      <h2>Hello! My name is Tessa and here I will document my experience with downsizing to live tiny.</h2>

      <p>It all started with my own downsizing journey in 2018. My shopping habits had gotten ridiculously out of hand... my sister and I were running out of space in our 900 square foot apartment. I knew I had a problem when I realized how much storage I had to buy to contain all of my 'stuff'.  My bad habits of mindless purchasing and stockpiling extra items were quickly catching up to me. It felt as if the apartment was shrinking due to the floor space slowly being taken up by anything that couldn't fit in a closet or dresser.</p>

​

      <p>Change began with 'Minimalism', a life-changing documentary by Ryan Nicodemus and Johnathan Fields Millburn. Soon after completing 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up', I was more motivated than ever to adjust the way I was living and scale back drastically on my belongings.</p>

​

      <p>Now, 2 years later and I live in a 450 square foot bachelor downtown with a third of my belongings and I have never been more content with my peaceful life. I believe I have mastered the act of downsizing and want to help you next!</p>
